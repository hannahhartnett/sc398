## Introduction

|           In the year of the 'new normal,' we have experienced many momentous and novel events: a global pandemic; increased awareness of national racial injustices, specifically on the part of the police force, as a result of the murders of countless Black Americans; and a contentious presidential election. This interactive app is intended as an accompaniment to year-end news summaries, to aid investigation of violent and non-violent protests as a response to these significant new phenomena. How have Americans gathered to react to national events in 2020? The app was created using data from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project: https://acleddata.com/curated-data-files/. This dataset contains 23238 observations of both armed conflicts and peaceful protest events in 2020; each of these observations captures one day on which an event took place, so a single event can be represented by multiple observations if the event spans multiple days. The dataset has 31 variables, including the type of event, date, location, main actors, number of fatalities, and general descriptive notes, as well as 9 variables we created to aid in data visualization, such as an indicator variable for Black Lives Matter protests.

|           The app is intended for a general audience to use to answer questions such as the following: 
* Did peaceful protests increase or decrease in the United States after the beginning of lockdown orders in March 2020?
* Was there an increase in protests 'with intervention' in the United States after the murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and other Black Americans in the spring of 2020? Where did these protests occur?
* How did the type and location of protests change over the course of the presidential election? Can we identify pro-Trump and pro-Biden protests?

## Usage Example

|           The four tabs of our app are used to organize the protest data into intuitive categories for a general audience without a lot of background knowledge on political conflict or data visualization. 

|           The first tab of the app contains a map displaying all protest events that occurred in the United States over the course of 2020. Each point represents one day on which the event occurred. Hovering over a point shows the date, type of event, and location, and clicking on the point displays notes about what took place. The slider changes the time frame displayed by the plot, and choosing the Sub-Event Type to the left will also filter this map accordingly. This filtering of the map will allow for users of the app to educate themselves about riots, battles, and protests that they otherwise would not have known about, as well as how these events have shaped American life and politics, by examining the effects of the protests written in the notes. The slider allows users to examine trends in volume and location of protests in certain periods of the year. It is important to note that the graph is only capable of showing one point per location. Zooming further into the map can show more points as the locations become more clearly defined, but if more than one protest occurs during the date range in a specific location, only one set of notes will appear.
|           The bar graph alongside the map provides quantitative information about event type. While it is clear that peaceful protests were the most commonly occurring event type, the user can also drill down by date. When exploring different time frames, we can see a large increase in violent demonstrations in the second half of the year. From January to mid-May, there were only 8, but in the rest of the year, during the peak of the Black Lives Matter protests and continuing through the presidential election, there were over 700 violent demonstrations.
|           The final plot on the first page shows the number of protests per day by state. We observe many meaningful differences by state; the protests during the peak of the Black Lives Matter movement peak earlier in Minnesota, the home state of George Floyd, than in most other states. We also see that in Florida, a key battleground state in the election, has much higher protest counts throughout the fall, when candidates likely spent increased time campaigning there. Though Washington D.C. experiences significantly fewer protests than most other states, likewise we see protests peak in the fall. It is very important to note that these protest counts can be misleading as they do not take state population into consideration; this graph is intended to compare counts in one state over time, or to compare time series trends between states, but not to compare counts between states.
  

|           The final tab utilizes another map to dive into the growth of the Black Lives Matter movement. This map has many of the same dynamic options as our opening map, with the exception that the time frame is pre-selected. The Black Lives Matter Movement has grown tremendously in the United States over the course of 2020; based on the time frames, changes in frequency of protests associated with BLM are easily visible. After George Floyd's death, the number of BLM protests sees a dramatic spike and this continues into June. As time wears on for the rest of the year, the number of protests gradually drops, but the protest events are still much more frequent than in the first five months of 2020. The protests associated with George Floyd's death raised awareness and allowed more people to join the cause and protest against other instances of violence against Black lives. In the later months of 2020 not all points directly reference George Floyd in the notes, and instead focus on other American citizens and their stories.

## Design Choices

|           We included the maps so that people using the app could get a feel for where and when these events have happened. Using leaflet was important to form a realism to the map and allow for users to zoom in and out to see the location of these events in great detail. We made the maps filterable by time frame and event type so that the information could be more digestible without too many points at once. Leaflet was also helpful for making very accessible labels and pop-up notes so users could easily read more information on individual events.
|           The bar graph accompanying the first map provides the user with additional quantitative information about the protest types, as it is quite difficult to accurately estimate counts by viewing on dots on a map. We utilized plotly to allow the user to mouse over for a count label since some event types have a large disparity in frequency. For example, when looking at strategic developments over the whole year, the scale goes to 20,000 and it is almost impossible to discern that there were 116 events with 'excessive force against protestors.'
|           The time series plot features labels of two key events in the timeline of 2020, the death of George Floyd, and the presidential election, to allow users to examine changes in protest frequency as a result of these events. Filtering by state allows the user to explore differences in trends based on location, as protests are often related to regional events.
|           The first fatality plot displays actors involved in incidents grouped by whether there was a fatality. Users are able to select between two bar charts - one that displays total count of groups involved by fatality event and the other that displays proportion of groups involved by fatality event. A Plotly feature displays the raw count by group highlighted. The choice between a count and proportional bar chart allows the user to visualize both the raw count of fatality incidence by groups involved and the proportion of fatality incidence by groups involved. The count plot illustrates the significantly higher occurrence of non-fatal events in the dataset. The proportional bar plot allows the user to then examine the proportion of count of groups involved in fatal and non-fatal incidents. This displays some interesting features and allows us to take a closer look at the fatal incident group and highlights the prevalence of police involved fatal events.
|           The second fatality plot shows the total number of fatalities by month over the 2020 calendar year. The Plotly feature allows for a mouseover that shows both raw count by month and the number of these fatal events over the total number of events in that month as a percentage. The interaction in the second plot allows the user to deeper examine fatality events by month. The visualization shows both the count and the count as a percentage of total events. This allows us to both examine the trends in fatalities and see them within the context of total events.

## Appendix

|           After our meetings with Jerzy, we worked to combine plots to be able to be modified at the same time as each other using a shiny html widget. We added annotations to the time series plot to mark key events in the US in 2020. We revised our app so that format of our writing and our graph colors were more consistent. Jerzy also helped us to notice some spatial changes that we could make in order to make the app look more clean, such as more readable plot axis and labels, as well has fully viewable plot windows in the app that don't require the user to scroll down.
